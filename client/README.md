# Front apps

Installation
Open a new terminal and go to the client folder.

First install the dependencies with your favorite manager, if you use npm is:
npm install

Then copy the content in node_extra_dependencies on node_modules folder and then go to each folder that you copy and execute again the installation command on each.

! Important: Finally delete the line that contains "react-swipeable-views" in the main package.json because at this moment this package not work with react +18 versions.
